# Machine Learning Classification README

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing data classification using various machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Back-Propagation (BP), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The objective is to analyze datasets, select appropriate parameters for each algorithm, and evaluate the classification results.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:

1. Analyze datasets: Ring data set, Bank dataset, and Boston House Price.
2. Perform supervised training of classification models using SVM, BP, and MLR.
3. Select optimal parameters for each algorithm through cross-validation.
4. Evaluate the quality of classification results on test and validation sets.
5. Compare confusion matrices and ROC curves for the three algorithms.

## Dataset

The following datasets are used for training and evaluation:

1. Ring data set
2. Bank dataset
3. Boston House Price

## Libraries Used

- Python libraries for SVM: scikit-learn, LibSVM
- Python libraries for BP: TensorFlow, Keras
- Python libraries for MLR: scikit-learn

## Instructions

To implement the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4Pranjal/Machine_Learning_Project.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn tensorflow keras
   ```

3. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd Machine_Learning_Project
   ```

4. Run the Python scripts provided in the repository for parameter selection and evaluation.

 
## Example Usage

```bash
python parameter_selection.py
python evaluation.py
```
